# Better Professor

Pitch: As a professor, I have a lot of grad students I mentor. I'd like to help keep them on track, but I can never remember their project deadlines, or when my feedback to them is due. I need an app that allows me to enter in all the important dates by category (ie student project deadline, feedback deadline, letter of recommendation deadline, etc.) and automatically remind me or the student before the deadline. Never miss an opportunity to member ever again!

MVP: As a user I want to login and see a list of students I mentor so I can add to or remove from the list. I also want to click on a student and see a list of their important projects or research papers I am mentoring on. As a user I want to be able to create an automated messages to be sent to myself or a student I'm mentoring. A message should include a send date and time and a long text field that enables the message curator the ability to send a custom message.
